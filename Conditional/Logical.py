#Logical operators
#There are three logical operators: and, or, and not. The semantics (meaning) of these operators is similar to their meaning in English. For example,

#x > 0 and x < 10

#is true only if x is greater than 0 and less than 10.

#n%2 == 0 or n%3 == 0 is true if either of the conditions is true, that is, if the number is divisible by 2 or 3.

#Finally, the not operator negates a boolean expression, so not (x > y) is true if x > y is false; that is, if x is less than or equal to y.

#Strictly speaking, the operands of the logical operators should be boolean expressions, but Python is not very strict. Any nonzero number is interpreted as “true.”
