#When using the Python interpreter, you must leave a blank line at the end of a block, otherwise Python will return an error:

x = 3
if x < 10:
    print('Small')
print('Done')
  
  #File "<stdin>"
    #print('Done')
        #^

#A blank line at the end of a block of statements is not necessary when writing and executing a script, but it may improve readability of your code.
