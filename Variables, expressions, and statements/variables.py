#Variables
#One of the most powerful features of a programming language is the ability to manipulate variables. A variable is a name that refers to a value.

#An assignment statement creates new variables and gives them values:

message = 'And now for something completely different'
n = 17
print(message)
print(n)



#pi = 3.1415926535897931
