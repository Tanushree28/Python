#String operations
#The + operator works with strings, but it is not addition in the mathematical sense. Instead it performs concatenation, which means joining the strings by linking them end to end. For example:


first = 10
second = 15
print(first+second)
#25

first = '100'
second = '150'
print(first + second)
#100150
