#Tuple assignment
#One of the unique syntactic features of the Python language is the ability to have a tuple on the left side of an assignment statement. This allows you to assign more than one variable at a time when the left side is a sequence.

#In this example we have a two-element list (which is a sequence) and assign the first and second elements of the sequence to the variables x and y in a single statement.

m = [ 'have', 'fun' ]
x, y = m
#x
'have'
y
#'fun'
