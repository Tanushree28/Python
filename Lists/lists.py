#A list is a sequence
#Like a string, a list is a sequence of values. In a string, the values are characters; in a list, they can be any type. The values in list are called elements or sometimes items.

#There are several ways to create a new list; the simplest is to enclose the elements in square brackets (“[" and "]”):


cheeses = ['Cheddar', 'Edam', 'Gouda']
numbers = [17, 123]
empty = []
print(cheeses, numbers, empty)
#['Cheddar', 'Edam', 'Gouda'] [17, 123] []
