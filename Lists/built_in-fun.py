#Lists and functions
#There are a number of built-in functions that can be used on lists that allow you to quickly look through a list without writing your own loops:

nums = [3, 41, 12, 9, 74, 15]
print(len(nums))
#6
print(max(nums))
#74
print(min(nums))
#3
print(sum(nums))
#154
print(sum(nums)/len(nums))
#25
