#Lists are mutable
#The syntax for accessing the elements of a list is the same as for accessing the characters of a string: the bracket operator. The expression inside the brackets specifies the index. Remember that the indices start at 0:


numbers = [17, 123]
numbers[1] = 5
print(numbers)

#[17, 5]
